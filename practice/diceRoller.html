    <!-- This challenge is just a "sanity check", to make sure that you can use standard function syntax in your own custom functions.

Create a function named "diceRoller" that can return a random number between 1 and a specified maximum.

If you think along the lines of a dice, you don't specify a minimum - just the maximum. A "six-sided dice" or a "twelve-sided dice" or a "twenty-sided dice", not a "one-to-six sided dice".

Your function must take a number as a parameter, and use that number as the maximum when generating a random whole number.  -->
    <script>
      // this function generates a random number between 1 and the given number
      let diceRoller = (number) => Math.floor(Math.random() * number) + 1;

      diceRoller(6);
    </script>
