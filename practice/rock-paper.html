      // Complete the function rps(player1, player2) . The inputs player1 and player2 will both be strings representing a move in the game rock, paper, scissors. The input could contain words with any case but will always be a valid string and option. Your function should return a string telling the user who the winner was or if it was a draw.

      // Rules of the game

      // Rock beats Scissor
      // Paper beats Rock
      // Scissor beats Paper
      // In the case that both players choose the same option it is a draw

      // Examples

      // rps('rock', 'paper') => 'The winner is player 2'
      // rps('Sissors', 'paper') => 'The winner is player 1'
      // rps('paper', 'Paper') => 'It's a draw'

      // Note that capital letters shouldn't make a difference to the output.
