      // Sven has made a bet with friend Juan that he could find the literal needle hidden in a haystack. Sven knows of your talent coding and hopes that you can write a program to help him. You have a tool that can scan the pile of hay and represent it as a matrix (array of arrays). Each cell will contain either the string H representing hay or N representing the elusive needle. Return the location of the needle so that Sven can win his bet.

      // INPUT

      // An array of arrays (matrix) [[],[]] representing the haystack.

      // A cell stack[x][y] will contain either 'H' or 'N' for Hay or Needle.

      // Input will always have exactly one 'N'.

      // OUTPUT

      // An array containing the pair of indexes that point to the location of the needle.

      // It must be in the format [x,y]

      // EXAMPLE

      // Doing the Impossible

      // Suppose we had the haystack:

      // const stack = [
      //   ['H', 'H', 'H'],
      //   ['H', 'H', 'H'],
      //   ['H', 'N', 'H']
      // ]
      // In this example, we can see that the needle is in the 3rd array, and then the second element in that array. If we wanted to access the value N in code, we would need to call stack[2][1]. Once you have found the needle, return the position as a new array in this case [2, 1].

      // The Haystack will always contain a needle, so you don't need to consider that edge case. Check haystack.test.js for more examples.

      const haystack = [
        ["H", "H", "H", "H", "H"],
        ["H", "N", "H", "H", "H"],
        ["H", "H", "H", "H", "H"],
        ["H", "H", "H", "H", "H"],
        ["H", "H", "H", "H", "H"],
      ];
      //       let a = animals.map((animal) => animal.length)

      //       let divider = (x, y) => {
      //   return x / y;
      // };
      function findNeedle(haystack) {
        let result = [];

        haystack.forEach((row, index) => {
          if (row.includes("N")) {
            result.push(index);
            let y = row.indexOf("N");
            result.push(y);
          }
        });
        return result;
      }
      console.log(findNeedle(haystack));
