    <!-- Stash kitty There is a picture of a cute cat, and a moustache. Your task is
    to implement an event listener that will put the moustache where the user
    clicks, so you can give the cute cat a moustache. Implement the scaffolded
    function in *script.js* to accomplish this, and use the function in an event
    listener. Some tips: * Two event properties that will help here are *pageX*
    and *pageY*. These return coordinates of the mouse. Use console.log to see
    what is returned. * Two style properties you can use are *style.top* and
    *style.left*, although you could find another way to place the moustache.
    Note that you have to include units when you set these properties. -->

      function addStash(event) {

        let x = event.pageX;
        let y = event.pageY;
        console.log(y);
        stash.style.left = `${x - 90}px`;
        stash.style.top = `${y - 20}px`;
        console.log(event);
      }
      document.addEventListener("click", addStash);
