      // You're a developer! The other students are developers! The teachers are developers! We're all developers!

      // This means we have quite a few properties in common. We should probably organize that data. Time to make a class!

      // Complete these steps:

      // Create a class named "Developer"

      // Make sure it has a constructor.

      // The constructor should take three parameters: name, languages, and devType.

      // type of development (eg. "webdev", "gamedev", "serverdev", "dbdev") named "devType"

      // languages (eg. "javascript", "C#", "ruby", "python") named "languages"

      // the developer's name (eg. "Alex") named "name"

      // In its constructor, a developer should have variables to match & store the parameters.

      // The class should have a variable to track how many instances of a Developer have been created

      // Think along the lines of static, get & set keywords to do this.

      // For challenge test purposes, please make sure "Developer.count" returns the current number of instances of the Developer class.

      // "Developer.count()" will not pass the challenge tests -- please make sure it's a variable!

      // The Developer class should contain a function named "greet", that simply logs the developer's name in a nice human-friendly message like "Hello, I'm Alex!".

      // The Developer class should contain a function named "about", that simply logs the developer's languages & development types in a nice human-friendly message. For example: "I'm a gamedev that uses C#!"

      class Developer {
        constructor(name, languages, devType) {
          this.name = name;
          this.languages = languages;
          this.devType = devType;
          Developer.count++;
        }
      }
      Developer.prototype.greet = function () {
        return `Hello, I'am ${this.name}!`;
      };

      Developer.prototype.about = function () {
        return `I'm a ${this.devType} that uses ${this.languages}!`;
      };
    </script>
